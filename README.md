# my-cover-zino-eshop

This is me trying to redo a project tutorial which i am following, in my own in my own way. Think of it as a sort of mixtape material a rapper would do, cover an original song and murder it in a cold way. That's What I am doing here. Playing around with zino's eshop. Already Have it on my repository but it aint finished. Would Be updating it and This cover as I proceed on it.
